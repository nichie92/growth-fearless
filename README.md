Remember the comfortable days

Hi, I am Nick. Just passed my 28th Birthday, seen the rising sun 10,220 times and hoping to see another 10,220 more but this time with a clearer sense of purpose and drive.

From the days after my first initial heartbreak in 2019, I decided to embark on a journey of self-discovery and I have not stop ever since. It has been a year now and a lot have changed since. This is a list of things I've did since the breakup. 

1) Took up motorbike license and passed in 1 attempt (Proud)
2) Self-learn Video Editing using Adobe Premiere Pro & Davinci
3) Created and posted short IG/YT clips on both platforms for a client-friend 
4) Self-learn designing software using Sketchup & Rhinoceros 
5) Had an internship role with a interior design company
6) Traveled solo in Vietnam for a Month
7) Decided to dive head first back into Engineering
8) Picked up German Language
9) Started learning coding
10) Abstained from Computer Gaming for a year and proud
11) Took up the role of "truth-vigilante" by breaking down what exactly is happening back at home, to the minor bits. Unraveled a huge amount of discomfort, lies, vulnerability, and have never looked back since.
